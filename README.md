Attendance System Using Face Recognition 

 The automated attendance system is a web based application that records attendance for students. computer vision specifically facial recognition algorithms will be used to detect users faces and record their attendance. Updated web application development technologies will be used to build  the automated attendance system. HTML, CSS and JS also will be used for front-end Design. ASP.net will be used in both server side (backend ).  SQL will be used as a data base tech. of the web application. web application users will be able to navigate and record their attendance easily using the friendly user interface of the developed web application. the developed system concentrates  on making  the attendance recording process easier, faster and more efficient and also its going to reduce the effort of taking attendance by calling students names.  
 
 This project is about designing and building a fully functional web-based application that checks attendance based on face recognition that supports multiple platforms( i.e. android & IOS smartphones). The aim of this project is to Automate Attendance and reduce the effort of taking attendance manually.
